I'm a PhD student in economics at Brown University. 

My research interests are in applied microeconomics and applied econometrics, with a focus on metascience and improvements in the credibility of research. I also work in development economics.

I have an MPhil in economics at the University of Oxford and an undergraduate from the University of Western Australia, with majors in economics and music. Prior to graduate school I worked as an economist at the Reserve Bank of Australia.
