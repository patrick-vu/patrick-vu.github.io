I'm a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) of Economics at the UNSW Business School. 

My research interests are primarily in applied and theoretical econometrics, with a focus on how publication bias impacts the statistical credibility of published research and the quality of evidence-based policy decisions.

I received my PhD in economics at Brown University, where I was awarded the George Borts Prize for best dissertation. I have an MPhil in economics from the University of Oxford and an undergraduate degree from the University of Western Australia, with majors in economics and classical music.
