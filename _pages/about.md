I'm an incoming Assistant Professor/Lecturer of Economics at the UNSW Business School (beginning mid calendar year 2024). Currently, I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at Brown University, where I was awarded the George Borts Prize for best dissertation.

My research interests are primarily in applied and theoretical econometrics, with a focus on how publication bias impacts the statistical credibility of published research and the quality of evidence-based policy decisions. I also work in development economics.

I have an MPhil in economics from the University of Oxford and an undergraduate degree from the University of Western Australia, with majors in economics and classical music. Prior to graduate school I worked as an economist at the Reserve Bank of Australia.
