I'm a PhD student in economics at Brown University. 

My research interests are in applied and theoretical econometrics, with a focus on publication bias, replications, and improvements in the statistical credibility of quantitative research. I also work in development economics.

I have an MPhil in economics from the University of Oxford and an undergraduate degree from the University of Western Australia, with majors in economics and classical music. Prior to graduate school I worked as an economist at the Reserve Bank of Australia.
