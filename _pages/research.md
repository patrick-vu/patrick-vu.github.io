**Can the Replication Rate Tell Us About Selective Publication?** 2022.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('replication-rate')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][replication-rate-dp] ] </small>

<div id="replication-rate" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Selective publication is among the most-cited reasons for widespread replication failures. I show in a simple model of the publication process that the replication rate is unresponsive to selective publication against statistically insignificant results. I then show that the expected replication rate falls below its intended target owing to low power in original studies and issues with common power calculations in replication studies. I estimate an empirical model and find that these issues alone can account fully for observed replication rates in experimental economics and social science, and two-thirds of the replication rate gap in psychology. I conclude by discussing more informative measures of selective publication.
