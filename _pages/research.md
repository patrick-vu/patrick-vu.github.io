**Can the Replication Rate Tell Us About Selective Publication?** 2022.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('replication-rate')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][replication-rate-dp] ] </small>

<div id="replication-rate" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Selective publication is among the most-cited reasons for widespread replication failures. I show in a simple model of the publication process that the replication rate is unresponsive to selective publication against statistically insignificant results. I then show that the expected replication rate falls below its intended target owing to low power in original studies and issues with common power calculations in replication studies. I estimate an empirical model and find that these issues alone can account fully for observed replication rates in experimental economics and social science, and two-thirds of the replication rate gap in psychology. I conclude by discussing more informative measures of selective publication.

**Do Content Warnings Help People Spot a Deepfake? Evidence from Two Experiments** (with [Andrew Lewis][alewis], [Raymond M. Duch][rduch] and [Areeq Chowdhury][achowdhury]). *Revise and Resubmit*.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('deepfake')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][deepfake-draft] | Commissioned for the Royal Society Online Information Envirnoment Report[rs-report] ] </small>

<div id="deepfake" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
The rapid advancement of ‘deepfake’ video technology - which uses deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms to create fake videos that look real — has given urgency to the question of how policymakers and technology companies should moderate inauthentic content. We conduct an experiment to measure the public’s ability to detect deepfakes with the naked eye, both with and without content warnings. First, we find that in a natural setting with no content warnings, individuals who are exposed to a deepfake video of neutral content are no more likely to detect anything out of the ordinary (32.9%) compared to a control group who viewed only authentic videos (34.1%). Second, we find that when individuals are given a content warning that at least one video in a set of five videos is a deepfake, only 21.6% correctly identify the single inauthentic video. In the latter condition, nearly half of participants erroneously select more than one video, which provides suggestive evidence that content warnings of this kind may increase distrust in all online videos, including authentic content. A possible implication of low manual detection abilities is that individuals may need to rely on content moderation policies set by governments and technology companies — raising issues around trust in moderators’ judgments.

**Gender Inequality in Education and Kinship Norms in India** (with [Anu Rammohan][arammohan]). 2018. *Feminist Economics*.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('education-kinship')">Abstract</a> | [Paper][education-kinship] ] </small>

<div id="education-kinship" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Women’s schooling attainment in India continues to lag considerably behind that of men. This paper uses nationally representative district-level data from the 2007–8 District Level Household and Facility Survey (DLHS-3), Indicus Analytics, and the 2011–12 Indian Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II) to examine the role of socioeconomic and cultural factors in influencing gender differentials in schooling. The results provide quantitative evidence of the role of different economic and sociocultural factors on gender disparities in education. The empirical results show that economic development is an important factor in narrowing gender gaps in education, with wealthier districts more likely to educate girls than poorer districts. However, the norm of patrilocal exogamy, where wives migrate to co-reside with their husband’s kin, is associated with worse outcomes for women’s schooling relative to men’s schooling; and, in keeping with anthropological research, gender-differentiated inequities in education are more pronounced in Northern India.
