**Can the Replication Rate Tell Us About Selective Publication?** 2022.<br/>

Selective publication is among the most-cited reasons for widespread replication failures. I show in a simple model of the publication process that the replication rate is unresponsive to selective publication against statistically insignificant results. I then show that the expected replication rate falls below its intended target owing to low power in original studies and issues with common power calculations in replication studies. I estimate an empirical model and find that these issues alone can account fully for observed replication rates in experimental economics and social science, and two-thirds of the replication rate gap in psychology. I conclude by discussing more informative measures of selective publication.

**Do Content Warnings Help People Spot a Deepfake? Evidence from Two Experiments** 2022.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('deepfake')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][deepfake-draft] ] </small>

<div id="deepfake" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
The advent and rapid advancement of 'deepfake videos' — so named as they are fake videos made to look real with the use of deep learning artificial intelligence programs — pose serious challenges to our digital information environment. As the technology continues to improve and fake videos proliferate, there is uncertainty about how people will discern genuine from manipulated videos, and how this will affect trust in online content. This paper conducts a pair of experiments aimed at gauging the public's ability to detect deepfakes from ordinary videos, and the extent to which content warnings improve detection of inauthentic videos. In the first experiment, we consider capacity for detection in natural environments: that is, do people spot deepfakes when they encounter them without a content warning? In the second experiment, we present the first evaluation of how warning labels affect capacity for detection, by telling participants at least one of the videos they are to see is a deepfake and observing the proportion of respondents who correctly identify the altered content. Our results show that, without a warning, individuals are no more likely to notice anything out of the ordinary when exposed to a deepfake video of neutral content (32.9%), compared to a control group who view only authentic videos (34.1%). Second, warning labels improve capacity for detection from 10.7% to 21.6%; while this is a substantial increase, the overwhelming majority of respondents who receive the warning are still unable to tell a deepfake from an unaltered video. A likely implication of this is that individuals, lacking capacity to manually detect deepfakes, will need to rely on the policies set by governments and technology companies around content moderation.

**Gender Inequality in Education and Kinship Norms in India** (with Anu Rammohan). 2018. *Feminist Economics*.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('education-kinship')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][education-kinship] ] </small>

<div id="education-kinship" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Women’s schooling attainment in India continues to lag considerably behind that of men. This paper uses nationally representative district-level data from the 2007–8 District Level Household and Facility Survey (DLHS-3), Indicus Analytics, and the 2011–12 Indian Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II) to examine the role of socioeconomic and cultural factors in influencing gender differentials in schooling. The results provide quantitative evidence of the role of different economic and sociocultural factors on gender disparities in education. The empirical results show that economic development is an important factor in narrowing gender gaps in education, with wealthier districts more likely to educate girls than poorer districts. However, the norm of patrilocal exogamy, where wives migrate to co-reside with their husband’s kin, is associated with worse outcomes for women’s schooling relative to men’s schooling; and, in keeping with anthropological research, gender-differentiated inequities in education are more pronounced in Northern India.
